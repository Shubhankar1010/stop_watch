# stop_watch
The Stop Watch is constructed using the Java Swing library, known for its versatility and robust collection of components. 

Components like JLabel, JButton, JPanel, and various others from the Swing library are used to construct this application. The JLabel's setText() method is employed to display time. The Timer class governs the initiation, cessation, and resetting of time.

Essential methods within the project:

actionPerformed():

This method manages the actions or events associated with the buttons. It handles the behaviors of controls within the stopwatch, including "start," "stop," and "reset." Its implementation dictates how the components should respond upon button press.

updateTimeLabel():

Used for updating the elapsed time every second, this method also ensures the corresponding time label reflects the changes.
